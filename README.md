Our first group project, we decided to combine searching for a recipe with wine pairing options and movie choices from Netflix using a search.
------------
## 💻 _**index.html**_

------------
## 🎨 _**style.css**_
- adjusted styling to keep movie cards generated confined within specific dimensions

------------
## 📝 _**script.js**_ _**netflix.js**_
- accessed the Unog API to generate list of potential titles
- made sure to be able to display in the card div properly
- parsed the data from Unog
- cleaned up the output and fixed broken images and missing images
- created a form to search
- allowed a toggle to choose between movies or series
- generated the HTML code dynamically as it was requested
- created a back and forward feature to scroll through the choices
